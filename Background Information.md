# Background Information

## Amyloid[+] indicator:
- Pittsburgh compound B (PiB): a radioactive chemical to image beta-amyloid plaques in scans.
- CSF Cerebrospinal fluid: Aβ1–42 levels and the Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratio are markers of amyloid pathology

## covariates
- ε4 allele(/alio/等位基因） of APOE(gene): the strongest genetic risk factor for AD
- CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating (Clinical evaluation)

## biomarker candidate(predictor)
- sAPP: soluable + amyloid precursor protein (APP); Cleavage by different enzymes(alpha, beta-secretase)+cut in different places => sAPPalpha, sAPPbeta
- sAPPalpha: good, protective, synaptic plasticity(memory, learning)
- sAPPbeta: Bad => amyloid-beta peptide => form plaques
- Abeta peptide: form plauques (many forms, e.g., Abeta40)
- FTR(Fractional Turnover Rate): “update rate” how fast sAPPalpha is synthesized and degraded (metabolism dynamic); clearance rate from the individual compartment(?)
- FCR(fractional clearance rate): only focus on breakdown rate vs FTR: dynamics

**relationships**:
- sAPPalpha vs sAPPbeta (production preclude each other)
- FCR (clearance from the whole system) = 1 / [Delay Time + (1/FTR)]
- The Production Rate is calculated this way : Concentration x FCR
