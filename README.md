Logistic Regression

## Potential Hypothesis
1. If there was an increase in production of sAPPbeta or sAPPbeta/alpha production ratio in subjects with AD (production rate)
2. if there was a decrease in clearance of sAPPbeta and perhaps sAPPalpha in AD （FCR）
3. if there was a combination of effects such that some subset of AD patients might have an increase in production and a decrease in clearance to a variable degree. (1+2)
