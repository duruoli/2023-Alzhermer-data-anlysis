Logistic Regression

## Potential Hypothesis
### Model
1. If there was an increase in production of sAPPbeta or sAPPbeta/alpha production ratio in subjects with AD (production rate) ???: production rate=concentration * FCR (affected by baseline concentration heterogeneity?)
2. if there was a decrease in **fractional** clearance of sAPPbeta and perhaps sAPPalpha in AD （FCR）
3. if there was a combination of effects such that some subset of AD patients might have an increase in production and a decrease in clearance to a variable degree. (1+2)

### Special pattern
1. subgroups: without ApoE4, but AD
2. abnormal subjects: inconsistent subjects(PiB vs CSF), borderline subjects (0.12 CSF)
