## Goal
Identify sAPPbeta-linked biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease detection.

## Outcomes

Identified biomarkers:
- Fractional Turnover Rate (FTR) of sAPPb / FTR of sAPPa
- Fractional Clearance Rate (FCR) of sAPPb / FCR of sAPPa
- Delay times of sAPPb / Delay times of Ab40


## Major Contributions

1. Advocated for additional focus on Alzheimer's patients lacking the ApoE4 gene (more fine-grained analysis)
2. Established a cutoff to address the multiple testing problem.
3. Integrated both explanatory and predictive models for biomarker identification.

## Prospective topics

1. Exploring advanced methods, such as ML integration, for biomarker discovery while addressing interpretability.
2. Considering the addition of control variables in univariate regression and preliminary normal assumption testing.
3. Statistical validation for the established cutoff.
4. Addressing severe multicollinearity in variable selection (e.g., in Lasso).
