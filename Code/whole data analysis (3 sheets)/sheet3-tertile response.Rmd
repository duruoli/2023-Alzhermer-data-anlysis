# Study Description
## Study Background and Design

In our study, we focus on the "CSF ratio Ab42/40," which is a measure of the relative concentrations of two specific forms of beta-amyloid peptides, Ab42 and Ab40, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As noted in sheet3, our current response variable, Amyloid_Status, is a **binary** indicator derived from the CSF ratio Ab42/40, categorizing subjects as either positive or negative for amyloid pathology.

To enhance our analysis, we propose the creation of a new variable, Amyloid_Status_T. This variable will classify subjects into three distinct categories based on their CSF Ab42/40 ratios: "low," "intermediate," and "high." This tertile  classification allows for a more nuanced examination of the relationship between soluble amyloid precursor protein beta (sAPPb) related variables and Amyloid Status.

By moving beyond a simple binary framework to a more detailed tertile system, our study aims to uncover more intricate patterns and potentially more subtle associations between sAPPb levels and various stages of amyloid pathology as indicated by the Ab42/40 ratio. This approach could provide valuable insights into the progression of Alzheimer's disease and help identify early markers or risk factors for the development of amyloid-related neuropathology.

1. **Visualization (Histograms and KDE Plots):**

   - Providing a direct and intuitive comparison of variable distributions across groups (e.g., comparing sAPPb concentrations between APOE4+ and APOE4- subsets within intermediate level of CSF ratio Ab42/Ab40 subjects).
  

2. **Univariate Linear Regression:**

   - Quantifying differences between groups (e.g., regressing sAPPb concentration on APOE4 status within intermediate group).

3. **Ordinal Multivariate Logistic Regression:**

   - Regressing Tertile Amyloid-Status on potential biomarkers and confounding factors (e.g., Amyloid_Status_T ~ sAPPb concentration + sAPPb/sAPPa production rate + age + gender).
   - Amyloid_Status_T is an ordinal tertile variable, and the order is "low" < "intermediate" < "high". Thus, ordinal logistic regression rather than multinomial logistic regression is used.

# Data Summaries

## Variable Introduction 

### Response Variable: Tertile Amyloid Status

Based on the CSF Ab42/Ab40 ratio, Amyloid Status is classified into three levels:

- **High**: CSF Ratio > 0.16
- **Intermediate**: CSF Ratio between 0.1 and <0.16
- **Low**: CSF Ratio < 0.1

For other variables, refer to "Analysis_Sheet3_12192023.pdf".


# Statistical Analysis

## Low CSF Ratio Subset

### Subset Information
```{r}
df_low_CSF %>%
  group_by(ApoE_Status) %>%
  summarise(n=n())   %>%
  kbl(booktabs=TRUE, longtable = TRUE, linesep="") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left",
                latex_options = c("striped", "repeat_header"))
```
The observed severe imbalance in APOE status could impact the statistical validity of subsequent findings, warranting caution during interpretation.


### Univariate Regression

Formula: sAPPb related variable ~ ApoE_Status

Select models where ApoE_Status is statistically significant at a level of at least 0.1. This means that we have a 90% confidence level that ApoE_Status is indeed associated with the sAPPb related variable, accepting a 10% chance of a Type I error (identifying a false significant effect).

```{r}
# Initialize an empty list to store significant models
significant_models <- list()

# Loop through each variable in idp_names
for (idp in idp_names) {
  
  # Build the formula for lm
  formula <- as.formula(paste(idp, "~ ApoE_Status"))
  
  # Fit the linear model
  model <- lm(formula, data = df_low_CSF)
  
  # Check the significance of the Amyloid_Status coefficient
  coef_summary <- summary(model)$coefficients
  
  # The row corresponding to Amyloid_Status in coef_summary will be 2
  # Check if the p-value is less than 0.1
  if (coef_summary[2, 4] <= 0.1) {
    significant_models[[idp]] <- model
  }
}

# Now significant_models contains all models with a significant coefficient 
# for Amyloid_Status at a level of 0.1

uni_sig_idp <- names(significant_models)
```


Prior to adjusting for multiple tests, five models were identified as significant: `pdr_sAPPb`(p<0.1), `FTR_ratio_sAPPb_sAPPa`(p<0.1), `dlt_sAPPa`(p<0.1), `dlt_sAPPb`(p<0.1), and `dlt_ratio_sAPPb_sAPPa`(p<0.05).

```{r}
for(i in seq_along(significant_models)) {
  stargazer(significant_models[[i]], type = "text")
  if (i < length(significant_models)) { # Avoid adding space after the last model
    cat("\n") # This will print a blank line
  }
}
```

**Adjustment for Multiple Testing**

Given the 23 tests conducted, correcting for multiple testing is vital to maintain the integrity of the findings. Considering the close interrelationship among the 23 sAPPb-related variables, a slightly less "conservative" approach, such as the Benjamini-Hochberg method, may be more fitting. 

Below are the adjusted p-values:

```{r}
# Initialize an empty list to store p-values
p_values <- vector()

# Loop through each variable in idp_names
for (idp in idp_names) {
  
  # Build the formula for lm
  formula <- as.formula(paste(idp, "~ ApoE_Status"))
  
  # Fit the linear model
  model <- lm(formula, data = df_low_CSF)
  
  # Check the significance of the ApoE_Status coefficient
  coef_summary <- summary(model)$coefficients
  
  # The row corresponding to ApoE_Status in coef_summary will be 2
  # Store the p-value in p_values
  p_values <- c(p_values, coef_summary[2, 4])
}

# Now adjust the p-values using Holm-Bonferroni method
adjusted_p_values <- p.adjust(p_values, method = "BH")

# Initialize an empty list to store significant models
significant_models <- list()

# Loop through the adjusted p-values and check if they are below 0.1
for (i in seq_along(adjusted_p_values)) {
  if (adjusted_p_values[i] <= 0.1) {
    
    # Build the formula for lm
    formula <- as.formula(paste(idp_names[i], "~ ApoE_Status"))
    
    # Fit the linear model
    model <- lm(formula, data = df_low_CSF)
    
    # Store the model in significant_models
    significant_models[[idp_names[i]]] <- model
  }
}

# Now significant_models contains all models with a significant coefficient 
# for ApoE_Status at a level of 0.1, adjusted for multiple comparisons

```

```{r}
adjusted_p_values_df <- data.frame(
  idp_name = idp_names,
  adjusted_p_value = adjusted_p_values
)
adjusted_p_values_df %>%
  kbl(booktabs=TRUE, longtable = TRUE, linesep="") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left",
                latex_options = c("striped", "repeat_header"))
```
After correction, there is no significant model anymore.

**Normality Test**

The diagnostic normality test revealed that `pdr_ratio_sAPPb_totalAb`, `pdr_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40` do not conform to the normality assumption. This finding also implies that the previously conducted univariate linear regression, which assumes normal distribution of the data, is not suitable for these specific variables. Consequently, we should use U-tests rather than t-tests for these variables. 

After applying U-tests to them, the results indicate that our previous finding doesn't hold anymore, i.e., there **doesn't exist** significant differences in the level of `pdr_ratio_sAPPb_totalAb`, `pdr_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40` between individuals with APOE4 and those without in the low CSF ratio subgroup

```{r}
# Initialize an empty dataframe to store results
normality_test_results <- data.frame(variable_name = character(), p_value = numeric(), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Loop through each variable and perform Shapiro-Wilk test
for(var in uni_sig_idp) {
    if(var %in% names(df_low_CSF)) {
        # Perform the Shapiro-Wilk test
        test_result <- shapiro.test(df_low_CSF[[var]])
        # Store the variable name and p-value in the results dataframe
        normality_test_results <- rbind(normality_test_results, data.frame(variable_name = var, normality_p_value = test_result$p.value))
    }
}

# View the results
normality_test_results %>%
  kbl(booktabs=TRUE, longtable = TRUE, linesep="") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left",
                latex_options = c("striped", "repeat_header"))

```

```{r}
wilcox.test(as.formula(paste("FTR_ratio_sAPPb_sAPPa", "~ ApoE_Status")), data = df_low_CSF)
wilcox.test(as.formula(paste("dlt_sAPPa", "~ ApoE_Status")), data = df_low_CSF)
```

### Visualization

A preliminary comparative analysis is conducted via visualization (for the significant variables selected by univariate regression before multiple testing correction): `pdr_sAPPb`, `FTR_ratio_sAPPb_sAPPa`, `dlt_sAPPa`, `dlt_sAPPb`, and `dlt_ratio_sAPPb_sAPPa`.

Before p-value correction for multiple tests, there are two significant models: `pdr_ratio_sAPPb_totalAb` (p<0.1), `pdr_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40`(p<0.1)
```{r}

## High CSF Ratio Subset

### Subset Information
```{r}
df_high_CSF %>%
  group_by(ApoE_Status) %>%
  summarise(n=n())   %>%
  kbl(booktabs=TRUE, longtable = TRUE, linesep="") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left",
                latex_options = c("striped", "repeat_header"))
```
The observed severe imbalance in APOE status could impact the statistical validity of subsequent findings, warranting caution during interpretation.

### Univariate Regression

Formula: sAPPb related variable ~ ApoE_Status

Select models where ApoE_Status is statistically significant at a level of at least 0.1. This means that we have a 90% confidence level that ApoE_Status is indeed associated with the sAPPb related variable, accepting a 10% chance of a Type I error (identifying a false significant effect).

```{r}
# Initialize an empty list to store significant models
significant_models <- list()

# Loop through each variable in idp_names
for (idp in idp_names) {
  
  # Build the formula for lm
  formula <- as.formula(paste(idp, "~ ApoE_Status"))
  
  # Fit the linear model
  model <- lm(formula, data = df_high_CSF)
  
  # Check the significance of the Amyloid_Status coefficient
  coef_summary <- summary(model)$coefficients
  
  # The row corresponding to Amyloid_Status in coef_summary will be 2
  # Check if the p-value is less than 0.1
  if (coef_summary[2, 4] <= 0.1) {
    significant_models[[idp]] <- model
  }
}

# Now significant_models contains all models with a significant coefficient 
# for Amyloid_Status at a level of 0.1

uni_sig_idp <- names(significant_models)
```

Before p-value correction for multiple tests, there are 3 significant models: `FTR_sAPPa`(p<0.1), `FTR_sAPPb`(p<0.05), `FCR_sAPPb`(p<0.1)
```{r}
for(i in seq_along(significant_models)) {
  stargazer(significant_models[[i]], type = "text")
  if (i < length(significant_models)) { # Avoid adding space after the last model
    cat("\n") # This will print a blank line
  }
}
```

**Adjustment for Multiple Testing**

Given the 23 tests conducted, correcting for multiple testing is vital to maintain the integrity of the findings. Considering the close interrelationship among the 23 sAPPb-related variables, a slightly less "conservative" approach, such as the Benjamini-Hochberg method, may be more fitting. 

Behigh are the adjusted p-values:

```{r}
# Initialize an empty list to store p-values
p_values <- vector()

# Loop through each variable in idp_names
for (idp in idp_names) {
  
  # Build the formula for lm
  formula <- as.formula(paste(idp, "~ ApoE_Status"))
  
  # Fit the linear model
  model <- lm(formula, data = df_high_CSF)
  
  # Check the significance of the ApoE_Status coefficient
  coef_summary <- summary(model)$coefficients
  
  # The row corresponding to ApoE_Status in coef_summary will be 2
  # Store the p-value in p_values
  p_values <- c(p_values, coef_summary[2, 4])
}

# Now adjust the p-values using Holm-Bonferroni method
adjusted_p_values <- p.adjust(p_values, method = "BH")

# Initialize an empty list to store significant models
significant_models <- list()

# Loop through the adjusted p-values and check if they are behigh 0.1
for (i in seq_along(adjusted_p_values)) {
  if (adjusted_p_values[i] <= 0.1) {
    
    # Build the formula for lm
    formula <- as.formula(paste(idp_names[i], "~ ApoE_Status"))
    
    # Fit the linear model
    model <- lm(formula, data = df_high_CSF)
    
    # Store the model in significant_models
    significant_models[[idp_names[i]]] <- model
  }
}

# Now significant_models contains all models with a significant coefficient 
# for ApoE_Status at a level of 0.1, adjusted for multiple comparisons

```

```{r}
adjusted_p_values_df <- data.frame(
  idp_name = idp_names,
  adjusted_p_value = adjusted_p_values
)
adjusted_p_values_df %>%
  kbl(booktabs=TRUE, longtable = TRUE, linesep="") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left",
                latex_options = c("striped", "repeat_header"))
```
After correction, there is no significant model anymore.

**Normality Test**

The diagnostic normality test revealed that `pdr_ratio_sAPPb_totalAb`, `pdr_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40` do not conform to the normality assumption. This finding also implies that the previously conducted univariate linear regression, which assumes normal distribution of the data, is not suitable for these specific variables. Consequently, we should use U-tests rather than t-tests for these variables. 

After applying U-tests to them, the results indicate that our previous finding doesn't hold anymore, i.e., there **doesn't exist** significant differences in the level of `pdr_ratio_sAPPb_totalAb`, `pdr_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40` between individuals with APOE4 and those without in the high CSF ratio subgroup

```{r}
# Initialize an empty dataframe to store results
normality_test_results <- data.frame(variable_name = character(), p_value = numeric(), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Loop through each variable and perform Shapiro-Wilk test
for(var in uni_sig_idp) {
    if(var %in% names(df_high_CSF)) {
        # Perform the Shapiro-Wilk test
        test_result <- shapiro.test(df_high_CSF[[var]])
        # Store the variable name and p-value in the results dataframe
        normality_test_results <- rbind(normality_test_results, data.frame(variable_name = var, normality_p_value = test_result$p.value))
    }
}

# View the results
normality_test_results %>%
  kbl(booktabs=TRUE, longtable = TRUE, linesep="") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left",
                latex_options = c("striped", "repeat_header"))

Only **one** variable exhibited statistical significance: `dlt_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40`

However, it was only significant in 2 (<12) models, which implied that the significance of `dlt_ratio_sAPPb_sAPPa` might be coincidental.


*P.S. Justification for the Threshold of 12:*
We've executed a total of 9*14 = 126 tests. Our aim is to confidently state that a variable, denoted as X, showing significance in n or more tests is not a random occurrence. Representing the event of X being significant in the ith test by chance as Yi, where P(Yi=1) = 0.05 and P(Yi=0) = 0.95, and assuming each test is an independent event, we define sumYi as S—the total number of tests where X is falsely marked significant just by chance. Our goal is to ensure that P(S>=n) < 0.05, implying that the likelihood of X wrongly appearing significant in 'n' or more tests out of 126 is less than 5%. Based on these calculations, the cutoff (n) is 12.

## Further Examination of Collinearity:
for(model_name in names(significant_models)) {
  coef_summary <- summary(significant_models[[model_name]])
  
  # Identify the significant IDPs based on p-value < 0.1
  x <- coef_summary[-(0:length(control)+1), ]
  sig_idp_vars  <- x[x[, 6] < 0.1, ]
  
  controls <- significant_configurations[[model_name]]$control_vars
  idps <- significant_configurations[[model_name]]$idp_vars
  formula_str <- paste(
        "Amyloid_Status ~", 
        paste(controls, collapse = " + "), 
        "+", 
        paste(idps, collapse = " + ")
      )
  
  # Convert to formula object
  formula <- as.formula(formula_str)
  
  model <- glm(formula = formula, family = binomial, data = df)
  vif_data <- vif(model)
  # Check if any VIF is greater than 10
  if(any(vif_data > 10)) {
    # Output the model name and VIF data
    cat(sprintf("Collinearity Model %s:\n", model_name))
    print(vif_data)
  }}

```

Nevertheless, it might be still helpful to delve into the two significant models:

The model names are denoted using the following format: "Model: [Index of Control Variable Combination]_[Index of Independent Variable Combination]".

For instance, "Model(PMM):2_11" corresponds to the model configuration: Amyloid_Status_T ~ VentriCSF_Vol + (FTR_sAPPb + FTR_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40 + dlt_sAPPb + dlt_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40).

```{r, results='asis'}
for(i in seq_along(significant_models)) {
  model_name <- names(significant_models)[i]
  # Escape underscores for LaTeX compatibility
  model_name_safe <- gsub("_", "\\\\_", model_name)

  coef_summary <- summary(significant_models[[i]])
  
  table_output <- coef_summary %>% 
      kbl(booktabs = TRUE, longtable = TRUE, linesep = "", 
          caption = paste("$\\text{Model(PMM):", model_name_safe, "}$")) %>%
      kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left",
                    latex_options = c("striped", "repeat_header"))
  
  print(table_output)
}
```

**Regression Interpretation:**

Ordinal logistic regression relies on the *Proportional Odds Assumption*. This implies that the relationship between each pair of adjacent outcome categories (e.g., Low and Medium, Medium and High) is consistent in terms of the independent variables' effects. For instance, if increasing $x_1$ by one unit increases the odds of moving from Low to Medium (compared to staying in Low) by a factor of 2, the assumption would mean it also increases the odds of moving from Medium to High (compared to staying in Medium) by the same factor of 2.

The odds of `Amyloid_Status_T` (denoted as Y) being greater than a category \( i \) (low, intermediate, high) is given by:

$$\text{Odds}(Y > i) = \frac{P(Y > i)}{P(Y \leq i)}$$

For example, the odds of \( Y > \text{"low"} \) is \( P(Y > \text{"low"}) / P(Y \leq \text{"low"}) \).

The model equation can be represented as:

$$\text{logit}(P(Y_i > j)) = -\theta_j + \beta_1  x_1+ \beta_2 x_2 +...$$

where \( i = 1, \ldots, n \) (total observations) and \( j \) indexes the response categories "low", "intermediate", and "high".

For Model(PMM):2_11 (Model:2_12 is similar):

- **dlt_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40**: The positive coefficient for `dlt_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40` implies that increasing this variable by one unit increases the odds of \( Y > \text{"low"} \) by a factor of \( e^{3.219} \approx 25 \). This means a higher likelihood of being in a category above "low". Due to the proportional odds assumption, the positive effect is the same for the odds of \( Y > \text{"intermediate"} \), i.e., a one-unit increase in `dlt_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40` uniformly influences the odds of moving up from any given category by the same factor.

The finding suggests that higher levels of `dlt_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40` are associated with a greater CSF ratio of Ab42/40, indicating a lower likelihood of being Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. This aligns with previous results using binary Amyloid_Status, where a negative coefficient for `dlt_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40` indicated a reduced probability of being in the AD[+] category. Thus, higher `dlt_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40` values correlate with a lower AD risk and it might be a potential biomarker for AD.


*Note*: be cautious about the results since `dlt_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40` might be significant just by chance.

#### Assessing the Robustness of Imputations:

We utilized imputed data for our analysis. A key consideration in such cases is the robustness of the findings across different imputation techniques. If diverse imputation methods yield congruent results, it bolsters the confidence in the robustness of the findings. 

To delve into this robustness, we employed the default multiple imputation method. Impressively, all 2 model configurations maintained their significance with this imputation approach, and the estimates were largely consistent. 

Our analysis suggests that `dlt_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40` may be a potential biomarker for the CSF Ratio Abeta42/40. This inference is supported by the consistency observed across the two model configurations using different imputation methods. However, it's still very possible that these significant findings could be coincidental, given that we have done huge number of tests and only two configurations showed significance.

This uncertainty warrants further investigation to confirm the validity of `dlt_ratio_sAPPb_Ab40` as a reliable biomarker.
